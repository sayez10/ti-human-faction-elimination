A mod for Terra Invicta which allows for factions to become permanently unable to recruit councilors, by choking them out of influence.

It requires Unity Mod Manager to work (install using DoorstopProxy): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21

The mod has three main functions; the influence drain, the influence disabler, and the influence cap. On the 10th, 20th, and 30th years respectively, a powerful influence drain is applied to all AI-controlled human factions. By the 30th year, a faction needs the equivalent of 100% of the world in favor of it to simply survive. This guarentees that all AI-controlled human factions, unless they have extensive space infrastructure, will end up unable to consistently generate influence.

The second function comes into play when a faction has no living councilors, no stored influence, and negative influence income. If all three conditions are met, the faction is incapable of storing influence whatsoever - they cannot suddenly come back into existence by being randomly given a bunch of influence from events. This is permanent and can't be reversed!

The third function sets a hard influence cap of 5000. The intent behind this is to allow storing a decent amount of influence, without making it an utter chore to whittle down a faction (such as the Servants). The cap also can be adjusted or disabled.
