# Human Faction Elimination Mod
This is a fan mod for the game *Terra Invicta*. It allows for the permanent elimination of human factions in Terra Invicta, by choking them out of influence.


### Summary of Effects
So far the mod has two main functions: the influence drain and the influence disabler. On the 10th, 20th, and 30th years respectively, a powerful influence drain is applied to all AI-controlled human factions. By the 30th year, a faction needs the equivalent of 100% of the world in favor of it to simply survive. This guarentees that all AI-controlled human factions, unless they have extensive space infrastructure, will end up unable to consistently generate influence.

The second function comes into play when a faction has no living councilors, no stored influence, and negative influence income. If all three conditions are met, the faction is incapable of storing influence whatsoever - they cannot suddenly come back into existence by being randomly given a bunch of influence from events. This is permanent for the rest of the ongoing campaign and can't be reversed!
